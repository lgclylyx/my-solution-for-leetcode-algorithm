/*
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

For example:

2, [[1,0]]

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

2, [[1,0],[0,1]]

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

	本质上来说，这是要判断一幅有向图中是否有环。下面的方法是拓扑排序，相当于BFS，在拓扑排序中，如果找不到入度为0的节点则有环。
	还可以使用DFS，但是要记录相应的访问路径中的节点
